# RemarkedUp
RemarkedUp transforms markup files into HTML with a nice typography.

## What's behind RemarkedUp
RemarkedUp uses MarkdownSharp (http://code.google.com/p/markdownsharp/) to transform, Blueoprint CSS for grid layout (the content column gets smaller) 
and some custom css extensions for nicer typography.
